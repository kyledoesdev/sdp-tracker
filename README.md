# Sleep Deprived Podcast Debate Winner Tracker :airplane:

### Static Branch

As of July/25/2023, my free AWS hosting ran out. So this is the static version of 
the tracker website.

Utilizes:
- HTML
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5

## Episode 150 Patch Notes
Episode 150 saw the return of "Jschlatt" to the podcast. The podcast is now a patreon exclusive show & the gaming
lets play episodes are now the primary focus of the Sleep Deprived Brand. In accordance with this change, the landing
page is now exclusive to season 3 & season 2 & 1 are accessible via the nav section in the top right.

### Kyle Notes
The html keeps getting messier & messier, but I am too broke to afford AWS for another laravel app. Maybe one day.

## Version: 0.60.0 Patch Notes
Episode 100 saw the depature of "Jschlatt" from the podcast. In accordance with this change, the podcast has
entered season 2. The "seasons" have now been split into two seperate pages.

For suggestions and corrections feel free to start an issue.
