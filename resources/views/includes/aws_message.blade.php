            Attention SDP Gamers, on August 1st, 2023, the AWS hosting free tier I've been using
            to host this website will run out. From past experience, I know that hosting a website with no traffic on
            the cheapest AWS plan is like 50$ a month. So it will probably be more for this website, most likely $100+ a month.
            (It would probably vary based off of the user traffic.)

            <br><br>

            That being said, <b>I have no intention of shutting down the website</b>, but I can't afford what it will cost
            on AWS, so I will most likely convert the site to a static page. TLDR, this means:

            <ul>
                <li>No more view counter at the bottom of the screen</li>
                <li>No search function or page buttons (each season will be on its own page)</li>
                <li>It will take longer for me to update the website each week. (I will have to manually alter the HTML)</li>
                <li>I can host it for <b>free.</b></li>
            </ul>


            The change should be minimal for you guys tbh, unless you like the page view counter like me.

            <br><br>

            If anyone does want to finance the website though, feel free to reach out to me using the links at the bottom of the page.
